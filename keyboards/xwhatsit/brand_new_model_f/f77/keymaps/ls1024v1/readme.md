# lstarnes1024's V1
This is based on the official ANSI HHKB split shift, regular backspace with
numpad layout. Like on the HHKB, this layout swaps left Ctrl and Caps.

## Differences from official F77 layouts 
* Use one-shot (OSL) for FN key instead of MO. The FN key's placement isn't great
  for people like me who need the ~ key. 
* Always enable NKRO and LTO (should probably be keyboard-level options, but 
  they're here for prototyping)
* Disable mousekey too.
